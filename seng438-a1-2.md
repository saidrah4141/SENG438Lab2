# Introduction

In this lab we were given two versions of an ATM system and tested the system using exploratory, manual scripted testing, and regression testing. Initially we had to spend 30 minutes to perform an exploratory test where the tester is given the ability to freely explore the program and learn the system and unocover ant unexpected issues that aren't always found in the scripted testing. What we learned about exploratory testing is understanding the requirment of the program then creating tests based on that. We created high level test plan to guide our exploratory testing. After completing the exploratory testing phases and reporting any bugs we encountered we moved onto the manual scripting tests. We foud manual testing more structered and it was explicit in what the expected outcomes were. The manual scripted tests were provided to us and we found it easier than exploratory because it was more detailed and it ensured to test if all software specifications were functional. Lastly we performed regression testing on the newest version next version of the software,1.1, the prior being 1.0. The regression testing allowed us to check if the bugs in the previous versions were fixed and if there were any new unexpected bugs.
